## State of accessibility

What is the current state of accessibility in the browser? Which browser
has the best accessibility support for HTML5 elements? Which elements
still need a semantic polyfill? How do browser processing models impact
accessibility performance? What does the future of accessibility
mechanics in the browser look like?

Léonie will endeavour to answer these (and other) questions that touch
on code, performance, reliability, and the future possibilities of
accessibility mechanics in the browser.
