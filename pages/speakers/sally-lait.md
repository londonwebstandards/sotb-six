You’re at a conference! You’re listening to interesting talks, getting inspired by being around like-minded folks, and preparing to take everything back to work on Monday. You’re going to change the world! Except… it’s not always that easy, is it?

In this session we’ll look at standards in the context of practical tips to help take others along on that journey too. Using examples from Sally’s work at Monzo and beyond, we’ll discuss how to empower the people around you, and ultimately how and why we should be making a better web for everyone.
