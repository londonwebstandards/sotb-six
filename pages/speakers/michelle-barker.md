CSS Grid gives us incredible powers for building web layouts, and there has never been a better time to start using it in production. But with so many different ways to create a grid and place items, it’s not always easy to debug when layouts don’t behave as we expect them to.

In this talk we’ll examine some common problems, and put the CSS Grid specification under the microscope to understand some of Grid’s surprising behaviours. We’ll take a look at how Grid works in harmony with (and not against!) other layout methods to build the robust, flexible web of the future.
