This year we have a range of tickets:

<dl>
  <dt>Single Ticket (£30)</dt>
  <dd>This is a normal ticket that will get you in to the conference and is our cheapest ticket.</dd>
  <dt>Diversity Ticket (£50)</dt>
  <dd>This includes <strong>2</strong> tickets: one for yourself and one for another person who needs help getting a ticket.<br>
    <a href="#diversity-tickets">More about Diversity Tickets</a>.</dd>
  <dt>Helper Ticket (£40)</dt>
  <dd>This is the ticket you need if you think <em><q>Wow this is cheap</q></em>, and you want to help out by donating an extra £10.</dd>
</dl>

All of the tickets get you exactly the same on the day.

Those that choose a **Diversity** or **Helper** ticket will get a mention here, on the website, if you wish.
