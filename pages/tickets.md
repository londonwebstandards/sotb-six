This year we have a range of tickets:

<dl>
  <dt>IRL Ticket (£30)</dt>
  <dd>This ticket will get you a seat at <strong>Conway Hall</strong>, providing the pandemic rules allow us to be there. If we are unable to hold the conference in-person, your ticket will become a Virtual Ticket. <strong>We apologise, but we can not refund the difference as we still need to pay for the venue.</strong> If you are not happy to take the risk, buy a virtual ticket instead.</dd>
  <dt>Virtual Ticket (£15)</dd>
  <dd>This ticket will get you access to a live stream of the event and access to the event Discord where you will be able to interact with other attendees, speakers, and organisers.</dd>
  <dt>IRL Diversity Ticket (£50)</dt>
  <dd>This includes <strong>2</strong> tickets: one for yourself and one for another person who needs help getting a ticket to the event IRL.<br><a href="#diversity-tickets">More about Diversity Tickets →</a></dd>
  <dt>Virtual Diversity Ticket (£20)</dt>
  <dd>This includes <strong>2</strong> tickets: one for yourself and one for another person who needs help getting a ticket to the event virtually.<br><a href="#diversity-tickets">More about Diversity Tickets →</a></dd>
  <dt>Helper Ticket (£40)</dt>
  <dd>This is the ticket you need if you think, <em><q>Wow this is cheap</q></em>, and you want to help out by donating an extra £10.</dd>
</dl>

Those that choose a **Diversity** or **Helper** ticket will get a mention here, on the website, if you wish.

  <dt>How do Diversity Tickets work?</dt>
  <dd>With your purchase of a Diversity Ticket, you will receive a ticket to _State of the Browser_, **and** you will also enable another person to come and enjoy the conference as well.</dd>
  <dt>Who receives the extra ticket?</dt>
  <dd>Anyone from an under-represented group or in a financial situation which makes buying a ticket normally difficult is encouraged to <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSd767T4I7HY7p9v_1NODUhts3xhNoL0QtGNO5BveYp8ruyKFg/viewform?usp=sf_link" title="Apply for a Diversity Ticket" rel="nofollow external">apply for a diversity ticket</a>.
