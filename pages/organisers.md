To our immense sadness, we have lost one of our organisers to cancer, Rupert Bowater. He’s been our rock for many years, often behind the curtains, with his humble but fierceful encouragement. He was our chief proofreader, our base for group meetings, and often a sponsor for LWS in any way he could through his company, Binary Vision. He always knew the most appropriate and diplomatic way to talk to everyone, and, ultimately he was also a huge supporter of women in tech. He has left a huge hole in our group. We’ll forever miss him. This year’s SOTB is dedicated to him.
