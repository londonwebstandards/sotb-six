London Web Standards has always been about Community and not making money, but organising a conference like State of the Browser is not easy or cheap. So this year, for the first time, we have a number of ticket types available: Normal/Diversity/Helper.

A **normal** ticket does what it says: it gets you a ticket for the event. A **diversity** ticket gets you and someone, who, for some reason, would struggle to get a ticket. A **helper** ticket gives us an extra £10 to help with the costs of the event.

Below is a list of those kind people who bought either a _Diversity_ or _Helper_ ticket—you should follow them on Twitter. There are others who wanted to remain anonymous which we’ve respected.
