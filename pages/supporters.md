London Web Standards, has always been about Community and not making money but organising a conference like State of the Browser is not easy or cheap. So this year for the first time we had a number of ticket types Normal/Diversity/Helper.

A **normal** ticket does what it says, it gets you a ticket for the event. A **diversity** ticket get you and someone who for some reason would struggle to get a ticket. A **helper** ticket gives us an extra £10 to help with the costs of the event.

Below are a list of those kind people who bought either a _Diversity_ or _Helper_ ticket and said they wanted to be known, you should follow them on Twitter, there are others who wanted to remain anonymous which we’ve respected.
